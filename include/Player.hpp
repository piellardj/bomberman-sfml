 *  (see Constants.hpp, BombManager.hpp).
 *
 *  A Player is controlled with the keyboard (cf PlayerKeyBinding.hpp).
 *
 *  A player is locailized on two levels:
 *  - location on the map (on which tile is it : _nLine, _nCol
 *  - location inside the tile: _dLine, _dCol, within 0..TILE_SIZE-1
 *
 *  A player can be either dead or alive ; a dead Player is no longer
 *  controlable.
 *
 *  A Player keeps a reference to a TimeManager and a Map,
 *  you must ensure they are not deleted elsewhere.
